Scavenger
-------
Scavenger is a discontinued Android app concept inspired by geocaching. The idea was to create a map of popular landmarks and motivate the users to explore unique places and let them track their progress by completing lists of nodes in cities/areas.

The project has already some components of the app working, namely basics of the UI design (see screenshots), Google Maps API integration, Google Sign-In authentication through the Node.js server, which uses a MongoDB database.
